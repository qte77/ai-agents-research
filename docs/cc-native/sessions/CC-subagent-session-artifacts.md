## What It Is

When Claude Code spawns subagents via the Agent tool, each subagent produces session artifacts: transcripts, worktree directories (if isolated), and metadata files. This doc covers the artifact structure, worktree lifecycle, and cleanup behavior.

## Worktree Isolation

Subagents can run in their own temporary git worktree by setting `isolation: worktree` in the [subagent frontmatter][sub-agents-frontmatter]. Each subagent gets an isolated copy of the repository at `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<hash>`, branching from the default remote branch (`origin/HEAD`).

## meta.json Structure

Each subagent worktree session produces a `meta.json` alongside its `.jsonl` transcript. This file is a tombstone recording the subagent's configuration:

```json
{
  "agentType": "general-purpose",
  "worktreePath": "<repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<hash>",
  "description": "<task label passed to the Agent tool>"
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agentType` | Which [built-in subagent type][sub-agents] was used (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) |
| `worktreePath` | Absolute path where the temporary worktree was created on disk |
| `description` | Task label passed to the Agent tool by the parent conversation |

The `worktreePath` is historical only — worktrees are cleaned up on completion (see below). The path is never re-used; it records where the worktree *was*, not where it *is*.

**Note**: meta.json is **not documented** in any first-party source. Structure observed from Opus 4.6 session artifacts, 2026-04-13.

## Transcript Storage

Subagent transcripts are stored alongside the parent session's transcripts:

```text
~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/<parent-session-id>/subagents/agent-<hash>.jsonl
```

The `<project-key>` is the working directory path with `/` replaced by `-` (e.g., `-home-user-repos-my-project`). Each `.jsonl` file contains the full subagent conversation: messages, tool calls, and tool results.

## Cleanup Lifecycle

### Worktree cleanup

When a subagent finishes, worktree cleanup depends on whether changes were made:

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No changes | Worktree + branch auto-removed |
| Changes or commits exist | Parent session prompted to keep or remove |
| Orphaned (crash/interrupt) | Auto-removed at startup after [`cleanupPeriodDays`][settings] if no uncommitted changes, untracked files, or unpushed commits |

User-created worktrees (`--worktree` flag) are **never** removed by the automatic sweep — only subagent worktrees.

### Transcript cleanup

Subagent transcripts follow the same cleanup as parent session transcripts: deleted at startup once older than [`cleanupPeriodDays`][settings] (default: 30 days).

### meta.json cleanup

meta.json files are retained alongside the subagent `.jsonl` transcript for history/debugging. They follow the same `cleanupPeriodDays` lifecycle as transcripts.
