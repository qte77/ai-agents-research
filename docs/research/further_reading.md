## Future Research Areas

The following areas represent emerging or under-explored topics in agentic AI research that warrant additional investigation:

**Advanced Multi-Modal Agents** - Integration of vision, audio, and text processing for comprehensive environmental understanding beyond current multi-modal benchmarks.

**Long-Term Memory & Retrieval** - Advanced memory architectures for persistent knowledge retention and contextual recall across extended agent interactions.

**Human-AI Collaboration** - Frameworks for seamless human-agent teamwork, including explanation mechanisms, trust calibration, and collaborative decision-making.

**Adversarial Robustness** - Agent resilience against adversarial attacks, prompt injection, and manipulation attempts in production environments.

**Automated Code Generation Agents** - Next-generation coding assistants with advanced debugging, testing, and architectural design capabilities.

**Edge & Resource-Constrained Deployment** - Efficient agent architectures for mobile devices, IoT systems, and bandwidth-limited environments.

**Governance & Policy Implementation** - Practical frameworks for regulatory compliance, audit trails, and policy enforcement in agent systems.

**Long-Term Autonomy & Reliability** - Systems capable of sustained autonomous operation with minimal human intervention over extended periods.

**Domain Transfer & Generalization** - Techniques for rapid agent adaptation across different domains with minimal retraining or fine-tuning.

### Priority Research Focus

Based on current gaps and transformative potential, three areas warrant immediate attention:

**1. Compositional Self-Improvement** - Moving beyond single-agent reflection to systems that can redesign their own architectures, create specialized sub-agents, and evolve coordination protocols. This represents the next leap from current self-reflection work toward truly recursive intelligence.

**2. Persistent Contextual Memory** - Current agents lack genuine episodic memory across sessions. Developing memory systems that maintain context, relationships, and learned preferences over months or years is critical for practical deployment and user trust.

**3. Robust Human-Agent Teaming** - Most current work treats humans as either supervisors or users. Research on agents as true collaborators—with theory-of-mind, explanation capabilities, and dynamic role adaptation—is essential for high-stakes domains like healthcare, research, and decision-making.

- [Claude Evaluation Framework](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) - Anthropic (2025)
